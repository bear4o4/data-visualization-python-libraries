# Data Visualization Via Different Python Libraries

This repository contains various tasks related to the analysis and visualization of housing data. The tasks are implemented in Python using libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Repository Structure

- `task_1.py`: Data preprocessing and cleaning tasks.
- `task_2.py`: Sales data analysis tasks.
- `task_3.py`: Exploratory data analysis tasks.
- `task_4.py`: Functions to find data scientists with specific interests.
- `task_5.py`: Functions to find the most common interests shared with a given user.
- `task_6.py`: Analysis tasks on housing data, including identifying the most expensive region, population density, and income brackets.
- `task_7.py`: Visualization tasks on housing data, including relationships between housing median age and value, distribution of rooms per household, and total population by ocean proximity.
